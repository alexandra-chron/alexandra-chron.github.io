I am a second-year PhD student in the [Center for Information and Language Processing](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/) at [LMU Munich](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) under the supervision of Prof. [Alex Fraser](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~fraser/). I am broadly interested in transfer learning, self-supervised learning, domain adaptation and low-resource machine translation, in both supervised and unsupervised scenarios. I am currently working on improving cross-lingual pretraining for low-resource languages. In this line of work, I have proposed using a curriculum for pretraining masked language models to improve unsupervised translation for high-resource/low-resource language pairs. I have also worked on enhancing cross-lingual pretraining by including lexical information via unsupervised alignments from embeddings. Currently, I am exploring methods of improving pretraining via denoising auto-encoding leveraging typology information of low-resource languages, with the final goal of achieving better translation quality. 

 Before that, I completed my diploma (combined BEng and MEng) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) in Athens, Greece, department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). In my thesis, I explored ways of improving transfer learning with language Modeling for several classification tasks, most notably on emotion recognition, under the supervision of Prof. [Alex Potamianos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pBQViyUAAAAJ&hl=en).
