I am a fourth (and final) year PhD student in the [Center for Information and Language Processing](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/) at [LMU Munich](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) advised by [Alex Fraser](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~fraser/). My research is in natural language processing and machine learning.

I am interested in enhancing pretrained models for machine translation, multilinguality and domain adaptation by exploiting unlabeled data.  My most recent research focuses on parameter-efficient methods for transfer learning. I am particularly interested in combining information from different languages, domains or tasks to enable positive transfer using modular approaches, such as adapters, averaging weights of pretrained models, etc.

During my PhD, I have done internships as Research Scientist at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/), working with the [AllenNLP](https://allenai.org/allennlp) team (twice, remote) and at Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)) in Santa Clara, CA working with the [AI human language technology](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/language/) group. 

Prior to joining LMU Munich, I graduated with a diploma (Bachelor and MEng equivalent) on [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) from the [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ntua.gr/en/). My thesis advisor was [Alex Potamianos](https://slp-ntua.github.io/potam/).
