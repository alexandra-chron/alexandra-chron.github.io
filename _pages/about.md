I am a final year PhD student in the [Center for Information and Language Processing](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/) at [LMU Munich](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) advised by [Alex Fraser](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~fraser/). My research is in natural language processing and machine learning.
I am interested in self-supervised training for supervised (and unsupervised) machine translation and domain adaptation, mainly using monolingual or cross-lingual language models. My most recent research focuses on parameter-efficient methods for transfer learning.


Before starting my graduate studies, I obtained a diploma on [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) from the Nat. Tech. University of Athens (NTUA). My thesis advisor was [Alex Potamianos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pBQViyUAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I interned with the AllenNLP team of Allen AI twice (remotely). I was lucky to be advised by [Jesse Dodge](https://jessedodge.github.io/) and [Matt Peters](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K5nCPZwAAAAJ&hl=en).
