Alexandra Chronopoulou
======

I am a first-year PhD student at the [Center for Information and Language Processing](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/) at [LMU Munich](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) under the supervision of Prof. [Alex Fraser](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~fraser/). I'm working on multilingual Machine Translation. 

Before that, I completed my diploma (combined BEng and MEng) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) in Athens, Greece, department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). In my thesis, I explored Transfer Learning with Language Modeling for several classification tasks, most notably on emotion recognition, under the supervision of Prof. [Alex Potamianos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pBQViyUAAAAJ&hl=en).
